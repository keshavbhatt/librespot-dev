summary: Librespot is an open source client library for Spotify
description: |
  Librespot is an open source client library for Spotify written in Rust. It enables    
  applications to use Spotify's service to control and play music via various backends, 
  and to act as a Spotify Connect receiver. It is an alternative to the official and now 
  deprecated closed-source libspotify. Additionally, it will provide extra features which 
  are not available in the official library.
